# OpenClaw in GitHub Actions — Workspace

This is the agent's workspace. Files here persist across chain restarts.

## Structure

- `HEARTBEAT.md` — What the agent does on each heartbeat cycle
- `memory/` — Agent's memory files (daily logs, long-term memory)
- `SOUL.md` — Agent personality (customize this!)

## Customizing

Edit `HEARTBEAT.md` to change what the agent does. Add skills, change tasks, etc.
